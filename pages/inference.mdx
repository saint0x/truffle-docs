<div className="ml-4 text-sm text-gray-500">
  The challenge with modern LLMs isn't just running them - it's running them efficiently. Traditional approaches often sacrifice performance for flexibility or vice versa.
  
  Memory management is a large part of that bottleneck. Most solutions either:
</div>

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card>
    Waste memory for simplicity
  </Card>
  <Card>
    Sacrifice speed for memory efficiency
  </Card>
  <Card>
    Accept the limitations of their hardware
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<div className="ml-4 text-sm text-gray-500">
  We approached this differently. Every component in our pipeline is optimized for speed:
</div>

<div className="ml-8 text-sm text-gray-500">
  - Custom attention implementation that pushes hardware limits
  - Zero-copy token streaming for minimal overhead
  - Dynamic batching that adapts to real-world conditions
</div>

  The result? Response times that feel impossibly fast.

## Architecture That Scales

<div className="ml-4 text-sm text-gray-500">
Our architecture is built on three core principles:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Intelligent Memory Management">
    <div className="ml-4 text-sm text-gray-500">
      - The difference between good and great often comes down to cache efficiency
      - Our prefix cache system ensures consistent performance
      - Page-based memory management optimizes resource usage
      - Designed for sustained high-speed operation
    </div>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Hardware Awareness">
    <div className="ml-4 text-sm text-gray-500">
      - Adapts to both cloud and Orb environments automatically
      - Optimizes resource allocation based on available hardware
      - Pushes hardware capabilities to their limits safely
      - Real-time performance tuning and adjustment
    </div>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Optimized Attention">
    <div className="ml-4 text-sm text-gray-500">
      - Reimagined attention computation for inference
      - Specialized optimizations for common patterns
      - Reduced computational overhead
      - Measurably faster response times
    </div>
