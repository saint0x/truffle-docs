<div className="ml-4 text-sm text-gray-500">
  The challenge with modern LLMs isn't just running them - it's running them efficiently. Traditional approaches often sacrifice performance for flexibility or vice versa. We took a different path: what if we optimized specifically for inference, and nothing else?

## Memory First, Questions Later

<div className="ml-4 text-sm text-gray-500">
  Memory management in LLMs is typically a major bottleneck. Most solutions either:
</div>

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card>
    Waste memory for simplicity
  </Card>
  <Card>
    Sacrifice speed for memory efficiency
  </Card>
  <Card>
    Accept the limitations of their hardware
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<div className="ml-4 text-sm text-gray-500">
  We approached this differently. Every component in our pipeline is optimized for speed:
</div>

- Custom attention implementation that pushes hardware limits
- Zero-copy token streaming for minimal overhead
- Dynamic batching that adapts to real-world conditions

<Card>
  The result? Response times that feel impossibly fast.

## Architecture That Scales

<div className="ml-4 text-sm text-gray-500">
  What makes Truffle special isn't just its speed - it's how it achieves that speed. Our architecture is built on three core principles:
</div>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Intelligent Memory Management">
    The difference between good and great often comes down to cache efficiency. Our prefix cache system and page-based memory management allows us to be not just fast, but consistently fast.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Hardware Awareness">
    Whether running in our cloud infrastructure or on your Orb, the engine understands its environment and adapts accordingly. This approach pushes hardware output to its limits, safely.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Optimized Attention">
    We've reimagined how attention computation works in inference scenarios. The results speak for themselves - though we'll let our speed tests do the talking.
